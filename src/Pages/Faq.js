                    The Binary digit, also referred to as BIT, is the smallest
                    unit of digital information in computing. It is represented

                    in the binary number system.

                    contrast, the decimal system is a base-10 numbering system
                    that uses 10 digits (0-9) to represent numbers.

                    NFTs while still in the holdersâ€™ wallets.
