                            The Binary digit, also referred to as BIT, is the smallest unit of digital information in computing. It is represented as either a 0 or a 1 and is used to store and transmit data in the binary number system.

                             The binary system is a base-2 numbering system, where each digit can only have two possible values, 0 or 1. In contrast, the decimal system is a base-10 numbering system that uses 10 digits (0-9) to represent numbers.

                             NFT staking on the BinaryBlock protocol is noncustodial staking in the protocol. Once staked, the NFTs are locked for a certain period, and crypto is earned on the staked NFTs while still in the holdersâ€™ wallets.
